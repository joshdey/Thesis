# Senior Thesis Project: Reservoir Computing and Nonlinear Dynamics
## Project Background
### Reservoir Computing
Reservoir computing is a computing framework derived from recurrent neural network models, allowing them to behave as dynamic systems as opposed to a function, making them ideal for solving problems involving time series data. Neural networks are named such because of their connections, or synapses, between the nodes, or neurons, essentially modeling a brain. A recurrent neural network has essentially three layers of connected "neurons". The first consists of a multidimensional input that is then connected to another multidimensional, but "hidden" network layer, which then leads to the output. Additionally, some outputs may connect back to the network layer if feedback is required. The synaptic connections are represented by matrices dependent on the dimension of the vector representing them. As with all machine learning algorithms, recurrent neural networks (and thusly, reservoir computing) require a training data set to update connection weights so that the error is minimized between the actual and target outputs; and typically, root mean squared error is used. In the reservoir computing method of training a recurrent neural network, all weights are kept fixed except the output weight, ultimately simplifying both the implementation and the training of the recurrent neural network.
### Chaotic Systems
Since the proposed project has much more to do with reservoir computing than chaotic systems, I will be very brief in this subsection. In its essence chaos is the opposite of what we've learned in physics courses over the last three years, aperiodic behavior _very_ sensitive and dependent on initial conditions, almost the exact opposite of the sinusoidal or periodic we've learned so much about. As per Shofer as well as Lu et al., reservoir computers have successfully been able to act as an observer for chaotic or nonlinear systems.
## Project
This project aims to further investigate reservoir computing as a whole and also investigate reservoir computers as an observer in chaotic systems. Specifically, I seek to study the Lorenz and RÃ¶ssler systems and find out why inference does not benefit from memory or nonlinearity in some cases.
